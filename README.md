# Neural network in Tensorflow Core

I implemented a ConvNet using Tensorflow Core and trained it using MNIST digits on Amazon Web Services. The dataset is taken from here: [Kaggle MNIST competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

## Structure

* ``network_tf.py``   - the main network which is trained on MNIST dataset
* ``datahandler.py``    - a class to handle MNIST data and feed minibatches into the neural network
